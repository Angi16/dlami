# TensorFlow AWS AMI aka TFAMI

Are you frustrated that many AMIs are not working to get TensorFlow working? Or that you have to waste time setting up your instances?

This is an AMI that I hope people, including myself, would continually monitor and ensure it works all the time. 

## How to find?
Under community AMI, search for TFAMI or `ami-d0e4adc7`. 

## Have a bug to report?
Raise an issue here and we'll update TFAMI to make sure it works or enable it across different regions.

## License
Open source of course! Check the MIT license in the repository.
